# Postmortems

Structured write-ups of incidents and significant failures. Each becomes durable knowledge: findings here feed the
`LF:` registry in `.salvor/DOMAIN_REF.md` and/or new entries in `.salvor/DEFERRED_TODOS.md`.

## Naming
`YYYY-MM-DD-[SHORT-SLUG].md` — artifact ID `PM:<kebab-slug>` (RULES §10.1)

## Template
- **Structured header** — ID / Subject / Claim / Evidence date / Status (RULES §10.1).
- **Summary** — one paragraph: what broke, blast radius, duration.
- **Timeline** — UTC-stamped sequence of events.
- **Root cause** — the actual mechanism, not the symptom.
- **Findings → follow-ups** — each finding tagged with where it goes:
  `LF:<slug>` (recurring failure mode → DOMAIN_REF), `deferred:<slug>` (out-of-scope fix → DEFERRED_TODOS), or `FIXED`
  (done in this pass, with commit).
- **What would have caught it earlier** — the missing test / check / alert.
