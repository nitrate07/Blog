# Design Decisions & Invariants

Dated, frozen records of **why the code is shaped the way it is — and what must stay true.**
Where `domain-learnings/` holds empirical findings and `postmortems/` hold incidents,
`decisions/` holds deliberate **design decisions and load-bearing invariants** — so a
fresh session understands the rationale *before* it changes something, including when it
touches an adjacent component that quietly depends on this one.

## Naming
`YYYY-MM-DD-[short-slug].md` — artifact ID `DEC:<kebab-slug>` (RULES §10.1)

## Entry template
- **Structured header** — ID / Subject / Claim (the invariant, one line) / Evidence date / Status (RULES §10.1).
- **Context** — the situation/forces that led to the decision.
- **Decision** — what was chosen.
- **Rationale** — the *why* that must outlive the refactor.
- **Invariant** — what must stay true; what NOT to "fix" without first understanding this.
- **Coupling / blast radius** — which components/files depend on this; touch with care
  (pair with a GitNexus impact check when the GitNexus MCP is active; otherwise use
  the best available structural search/review fallback).
- **Alternatives rejected** — and why.
